# Simple Space Situational Awarenss Neural network
# Features
# - observations made and missed
# - feature extraction via orbital parameters


# Use unsupervised learning to cluster satellites into groups based on
# TLE data
#   - try initially clustering by period, inclination and eccentricity
#   - for objects with similar period, inclination and eccentricity evaluate
#       by their right acension and phase at some point in time

# Object Features
# - object identifier
# - feature list (a key/value list of relevant data)
# - orbital parameters
# -
