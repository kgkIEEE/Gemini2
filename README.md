Repo for the Gemini2 recommendation engine framework

The Gemini2 recommendation engine framework is designed to provide the security, reliability and accountability necessary to use in operational settings.

The inputs to the system are policies and data.

Policies define appropriate responses to events by personnel in specific roles.

Data includes system status, historical data and information from external sources.

The recommendation engine converts policies and data into a prioritized list of recommendations.  

Recommendations consist of the role targeted for the recommendation, the recommended actions and the rationale behind the recommendation and its priority.

Recommendated actions take the form of playbooks as defined in the COCAO standard
